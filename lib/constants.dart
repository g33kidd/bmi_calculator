    "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.";

    "BMI is a useful measure of overweight and obesity. It is calculated from your height and weight. BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers.\n\nAlthough BMI can be used for most men and women, it does have some limits:\n\n- It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build.\n\n- It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle.";
